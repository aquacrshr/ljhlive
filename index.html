<body>Hello there! this is my first website.
  <BR><BR>
  You'll be able to post videos, and get to see my videos.
  <BR><BR>
You'll also be able to pick between pubic and private videos.
<BR><BR>
  But if you do pick public, other people who go to the website will be able to see it.
    <BR><BR>
  Are you ready to get started?
